1.
Sample JSON query:
a. Payment
{
	"type": "PaymentType1",
    "amount": 1,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "debtorIban": "debtorIban",
    "creditorIban": "creditorIban",
    "details": "details"
}
b. Cancellation
{
	"uuid":"803f46f1-8439-45c4-a36c-5eabc02463a0"
}
c. Query by uuid
{
    "uuid":"803f46f1-8439-45c4-a36c-5eabc02463a0"
}

d. Query all with optional filters. Sample query returns uuids of payments that are not cancelled and whose amount is [100, 200]
{
	"lowerLimit":100,
	"upperLimit":200
}

2.
Current approach: deserialization of JSON messages into subclasses with Jackson
@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME,
        include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY,
        property = "type")
@JsonSubTypes({
        @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = PaymentType1.class),
        @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = PaymentType2.class),
        @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = PaymentType3.class),
})
Plus: single target URL. Minus: type checking

Alternative: separate target URLs for each payment type
Plus: no type checking, separate URLs on client side. Minus: duplicated code (saving payment has the same steps regardless of type)

3.
class Payment annotations
@MappedSuperclass
@Entity
can't be used at the same time. MappedSuperclass results in the creation of separate tables for each subclass. Entity creates one table with all fields gathered from subclasses

4.
Security:
Each client should be authenticated. Only authenticated clients can use services. Client can cancel only their own payments. Client can query only their own payments.

5.
Request validation in controller (@Valid). Occasionally works, often throws no errors for invalid requests (currency violation). Don't know why.

6.
Testing
PaymentType repos don't have custom methods so I wrote no tests

PaymentServiceTest: Can't test private methods. Is there anything to test (composed of tested methods)?
addTimeAndUuidToPayment is already tested in model tests class. Repo saves are Jpa defaults. Controller won't pass in invalid instances (@Valid)

Requests/testing also performed with Postman

7.
Static code analysis performed with IntelliJ's Spotbugs plugin
